# Ninja-vs-Bots
A single player Unity game with first person perspective with coded Enemy AI.  
AI coded such that once they see the player, they switch positions according to anchors placed while shooting the player.  
More custom levels can be added to make it a full fledged game up for production.  
Files are too large to be upload on github.
